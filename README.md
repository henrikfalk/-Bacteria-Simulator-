# Bacteria Simulator

A bacteria simulation minigame - C# OOP in Unity

This is my Unity project for the tutorial "Submission: Programming theory in action" from the mission "Apply object-oriented principles" from the "Junior Programmer " pathway at "Unity Learn".

The goal for this tutorial is to demonstrate knowledge of OOP (Object oriented programming) using abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.

Enjoy!

## Status
In development.

- There is only one "FishtankScene" at the moment
- You can start a new simulation by pressing 'n' on keyboard
- You can add food to the fishtank (but has no effect yet) by pressing 'f' on keyboard
- The bacteria have a approximate lifespan. Then they die, turn black and falls to the bottom of the fishtank. After a period they dissolves in the water
- The status UI element is just a UI mockup


## The game
The game simulates the life of different bacteria types in a fishtank.

Keyboard:
Press 'n' for new simulation
Press 'f' for adding food

## Unity concepts
- Prefab variants
- "Glass" material
- Mouse selection using RaycastHit and child gameobject
- GameObject highligt when mouseover
- Use of StartCoroutine()
- TMPro package (TextMeshPro)

## Development environment
Unity Editor v2020.3.32f1 running on Manjaro Linux.

I used "GitKraken" as Git client.

## Prototype

This is my first prototype to test if I could make bacteria:

My second prototype that controls the bacteria amount to add:

Prototype 3: Status UI element and an "Add Food" feature:
